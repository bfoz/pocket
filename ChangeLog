20020901	Added this file
			Makefile no longer depends on bhf.post.mk
			Added 'test' target to Makefile which compiles a test program for intelhex
			The intelhex module is now in the intelhex namespace and uses STL containers

20020903	Changed all variables named 'hex' to 'hexd' to avoid confusion with 'ios::hex'
			Moved pocket_t et al to the pocket namespace
			Added write(ostream&) to intelhex for outputting to a stream

20020905	Updated the license text in each file header to be more specific. It now reads
