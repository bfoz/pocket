<h1>Unix Tools for <a href="http://www.bubblesoftonline.com/pocket/pocket.html">Tony Nixon's Pocket Programmer</a></h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>Tony Nixon has created an excellent programmer for microcontrollers that he is making available as a kit on his <a href="http://www.bubblesoftonline.com/pocket/pocket.html">website</a>. Currently the software provided for the programmer only runs in Windows which is a problem for those of us who don't use Windows. So, I've started writing some tools that will work in Unix. My development platform is <a href="http://www.freebsd.org">FreeBSD</a> so for now thats all these tools are guaranteed to work with. I'll gladly take patches for other OS's. I'd also like to work on a set of tools for PalmOS at some point. Very shortly I'll have a public CVS server going so others can checkout the code. </p>
